**Embeddings and UMAP in Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs**

This work investigates the potential of RDF2Vec, a popular embedding technique, for generating numerical representations of entities and relationships within knowledge graphs (KGs). While RDF2Vec has demonstrated promising results in previous studies, it exhibits inherent stochasticity, which can lead to inconsistent results across different runs. This stochasticity poses challenges for reproducibility and interpretability, hindering the utilization of RDF2Vec for downstream analysis. To address these limitations, this work explores alternative embedding techniques that prioritize determinism and interpretability. These techniques aim to provide consistent and meaningful representations of KG entities and relationships, facilitating more reliable and insightful analysis.
